Exercise 18:

Question: 

Explain how code coverage metrics like statement, branch, function, and 
line coverage help in assessing code quality for bookManager.js.


Answer:

Statement Coverage: Ensures that all executable statements are tested.

Branch Coverage: Checks that every possible path (if/else) has been executed.

Function Coverage: Verifies that all functions have been called in tests.

Line Coverage: Similar to statement coverage but measures actual lines executed.

These metrics help identify untested parts of the code, ensuring that 
critical functionality is verified and reducing the risk of bugs.
