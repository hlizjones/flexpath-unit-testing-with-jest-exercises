Exercise 1:

Question: 

Explain the purpose of unit tests in the context of the `addBook` and 
`removeBook` functions in bookManager.js. 

How do unit tests fit into the software development lifecycle for this module?



Exercise 2:

Question: 

Describe the differences between manual testing and automated unit testing for 
the `findBooksByAuthor` function. 

What are the benefits of using automated tests in this case?



Exercise 3:

Question: 

Implement test-driven development (TDD) by writing a test for a 
new function `updateBookTitle(oldTitle, newTitle)` in bookManager.js before 
implementing it. 

The function should update the title of a book.



Exercise 4:

Question: 

Write a simple unit test using Jest's `test` and 
expect functions to test `addBook`.



Exercise 5:

Question: 

Use different matchers to test `removeBook`, 
including the case where the book is not found.



Exercise 6:

Question: 

Structure test files using `describe` blocks to group tests for 
addBook, removeBook, updateBook, and findBooksByAuthor functions.



Exercise 7:

Question: 

Use hooks (beforeAll, afterAll, beforeEach, afterEach) to 
perform setup and teardown tasks for tests involving the books array.



Exercise 8:

Question: 

Use matchers like toBe, toEqual, toContain, toMatch, 
toBeTruthy, toBeFalsy, and toThrow in tests for 
various functions in bookManager.js.



Exercise 9:

Question: 

Explain the differences between strict and loose equality checks in Jest, 
and demonstrate with examples using toBe, toEqual, and toStrictEqual for 
objects.



Exercise 10:

Question: 

Create mock functions to isolate tests and avoid dependencies on fs in 
loadBooks and saveBooks. 

Mock the fs.readFile and fs.writeFile methods.



Exercise 11:

Question: 

Use Jest's automock feature to automatically mock the 
fs module and test loadBooks.



Exercise 12:

Question: 

Write manual mocks to customize the behavior of loadBooks for 
testing different scenarios, such as successful data retrieval and errors.



Exercise 13:

Question: 

Use spies to monitor calls to addBook and assert they were called correctly.



Exercise 14:

Question: 

Measure code coverage and understand metrics like statement, 
branch, function, and line coverage. 

Run Jest to generate a coverage report for bookManager.js.



Exercise 15:

Question: 

Collect coverage statistics using Jest and configure thresholds to 
enforce code quality. 

Set a threshold of 90% for statements, functions, and lines, 
and 80% for branches in jest.config.js.



Exercise 16:

Question: 

Explain how code coverage metrics like statement, branch, function, 
and line coverage help in assessing code quality for bookManager.js.



Exercise 17:

Question: 

Discuss the importance of code coverage thresholds and how they 
enforce code quality in a project like bookManager.js.



Exercise 18:

Question: 

Configure Jest to collect coverage only from bookManager.js and 
exclude other files or directories.
